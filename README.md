Estimote Beacons PhoneGap plugin
========================
- Just a wrapper around Estimote iOS SKD ( https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK )
- SDK not included, needs to be added in the build process
- *NOTE* This is work in progress, it's not even a beta version yet. **Everything may change!**
- *NOTE* It's my first encounter with Objective-C and PhoneGap plugins. Therefore, code may be rubbish, however ATM it's just a proof of concept. I will appreciate all input.
- Please **do** ask questions and give feedback.

## Proof of concept app
I was able to build an app on the top of this plugin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cgvEY4ywM8

## Build process
What I'm doing now to build my app is:

- I call `phonegap build ios`
- I open the your-app-name.xcodeproj (generated by PhoneGap) in the Xcode
- I add Estimote SDK ( https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK ) to the project like this: http://imgur.com/b2kkTW4
- I run the app from the Xcode

## Basic usage

    // start looking for beacons
    window.EstimoteBeacons.startRangingBeaconsInRegion(function () {
        //every now and then get the list of beacons in range
        setInterval(function () {
            window.EstimoteBeacons.getBeacons(function (data) {
                //do something cool with the list of beacons
            });
        }, 1000);
    });
    
## Some other stuff that you can do

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.connectToBeacon = function(major, minor, callback, errorCallback) ...`
Allows you to connect to the beacon by providing major/minor of the beacon.

- *NOTE* Connected beacon goes 'invisible' until it disconnects
- *NOTE* You can be connected only to the one beacon at the time.
- *NOTE* You need to connect to the beacon to do any *write* opperatons (update software, change frequency etc.)

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.connectToBeaconByMacAddress = function(macAddress, callback, errorCallback) ...`
Allows you to connect to the beacon by providing its MAC Address. I used that to connect to the beacons with old software ( < v1.6 ).

- *NOTE* You have to use startEstimoteBeaconsDiscoveryForRegion to connect to the beacons with old software.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.disconnectFromBeacon = function(callback, errorCallback)...`
Disconnects you from the connected beacon. Since there can be only one, you don't have to provide major/minor or MAC.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.setFrequencyOfConnectedBeacon = function(frequency, callback, errorCallback)...`
Sets the frequency of the connected beacon. You can set anything between 80 and 3200.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.setPowerOfConnectedBeacon = function(power, callback, errorCallback) ...`
Sets the power of the connected beacon. You can choose from -40, -20, -16, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.startVirtualBeacon = function (major, minor, id, successCallback) ...`
Device starts advertising as a beacon with given major/minor and id.

- *NOTE* You can't conect to the virtual beacon.
- *NOTE* Device that acts as a virtual beacon can still see other beacons, but won't see itself.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.stopVirtualBeacon = function(successCallback) ...`
Device stops advertising as a beacon.

`EstimoteBeacons.prototype.updateFirmwareOfConnectedBeacon = function(progressCallback, successCallback, errorCallback) ..`
Updates the softwere of connected beacon (if needed).

- *NOTE* I was able to succesfully upgrade 3 devices with that method so it's tested, but still - use it with caution! Make sure that beacon is near the phone, make sure that your phone has stable connection to the Internet and keep your fingers crossed.
